# ncaa-basketball-stats
This repo contains the code (in Jupyter Notebooks) and data files (in CSV and Excel files) for a data science project. The project is split into multiple parts - from initial steps like data acquisition, preprocessing, and cleaning to more advanced steps like feature engineering, creating visualizations, and machine learning. The dataset used in this project contains individual basketball player statistics (such as total points scored and blocks made) for the 2023-2024 NCAA womenâ€™s basketball season.

This project has been broken up into the following parts:
