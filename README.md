This repo contains the code and data files for a data science project using individual player statistics data from the 2023-2024 NCAA basketball season. 

In summary, there will be a notebook (and post) for each part of the process - from initial steps like data acquisition, preprocessing, and cleaning to more advanced steps like feature engineering, machine learning, and creating visualizations. The dataset used in this project contains individual basketball player statistics (such as total points scored and blocks made) for the 2023-2024 NCAA womenâ€™s basketball season.

This project has been broken up into the following parts: 
1. **Project Setup and Data Acqusition**
